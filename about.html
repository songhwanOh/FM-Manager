          <h2>About the Site and Its Creator</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to My Favorite Game website! My name is Steven, and I am the
            creator of this site. As an avid gamer, I have always been
            passionate about video games. One game that holds a special place in
            my heart is Football Manager, which is the inspiration behind this
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal with this website is to share my love for Football Manager
            and provide a platform for gamers to come together and discuss their
            experiences with the game. Whether you are a long-time fan or a new
            player, I hope you find valuable information and engaging content
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have put in a lot of effort to curate the content and design of
            this website, and I want to acknowledge the resources and references
            that I have used in its creation. All text, media, and other
            resources used on this site are cited appropriately to give credit
            to the original creators.
